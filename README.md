Day Out, or do., is a Tinder style app that allows users to "match" with new points of interest in the Nashville area. Using data from data.nashville.gov, do. pulls from Nashville's Public Art, Historical Markers, and Parks data. 

#our user.

We call our user the "Impoverished Influencer." Think millennial, think hipster, think school debt. Bryan, is the kind of guy that wants to be on top of the game when it comes to the next cool thing to do. He’s is looking to find interesting new ways to break his routine - and if they’re free, all the better. He’s already an outdoor exerciser, he takes his dog to the dog park, our goal is to expand on his behaviour and let him know what else there is to do. in  his area.
